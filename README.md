# ChatGPT Comparison.

## Initial Approach in (Solution1):
In this approach, you have a single loop iterating through the array.
When an odd number is encountered, it stores its index (index_of_current_odd_number) and the value in swapper.

It continues iterating until it finds an even number.
When an even number is found, it swaps it with the odd number stored at index_of_current_odd_number.
It sets swapper back to 0 and resets the loop index to the position of the odd number to continue the iteration.

## Second Approach (Solution2):
Your initial approach iterates through the array, swaps even numbers to the beginning of the array, and maintains the relative order of even numbers.

It uses two pointers (tracker and swapper) to keep track of the positions of even numbers.

## Comparison:
- Complexity: Both approaches have a time complexity of O(n) since they iterate through the array once.

- Memory Usage: Your initial approach and this one use constant extra memory (O(1)) because they don't create any additional arrays.

- Readability and Maintainability: Your initial approach is more straightforward and easier to understand at first glance. The approach in Solution1 involves more complex logic and might be harder to follow for someone unfamiliar with the code.

## Conclusion:
- Both approaches achieve the desired result of moving even numbers to the beginning of the array while maintaining their relative order.

- Your initial approach might be preferred for its simplicity and clarity, especially for developers who need to understand or maintain the code in the future.

- The approach in Solution1 demonstrates a different way to solve the problem using a different logic flow, but it sacrifices some readability and may be harder to understand for others.
Overall, both approaches are valid, but simplicity and clarity often outweigh minor optimizations, especially in code maintenance and readability.
